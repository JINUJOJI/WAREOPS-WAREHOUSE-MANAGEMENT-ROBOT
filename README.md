# WAREOPS: A Warehouse Management Robot

WAREOPS is a line-following, pick-and-place warehouse management robot developed as part of an engineering project at VIT-AP University. The system is designed to automate item transport within a warehouse using sensors, fork lifting mechanisms, and wireless communication.

---

## 💡 Project Objective

To optimize warehouse operations by automating the movement and placement of packages using a robot equipped with:

- Infrared sensors for navigation
- Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
- QR code-based route decision system
- Wi-Fi modules for communication with racks and user interface and used the camera modules to detect the size of the objects in the warhouse

---

## 🔧 Features

- **Line Following Navigation:**  
  The robot uses IR sensors to follow a predefined path within the warehouse.

- **Pick and Place Mechanism:**  
  A servo-controlled forklift system lifts and places boxes based on predefined height values (~4.5 cm at 90° rotation).

- **Obstacle Detection:**  
  Dual ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles and help avoid collisions during transit.

- **QR Code-Based Routing:**  
  At intersections, the robot scans QR codes to determine the correct direction.

- **Camera-Based Object Scanning:**  
  An ESP32-CAM module captures images of objects, which are analyzed via a YOLO model to determine object dimensions.

- **Web-Based Control System:**  
  A web server is used to start/stop the robot and receive image analysis results from the YOLO model.
